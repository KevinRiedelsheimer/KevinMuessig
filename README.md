### Hi there 👋 👨🏻‍💻

My name is Kevin and I'm currently working as a Developer Advocate in the [SAP Developer Advocacy](https://developers.sap.com/) team at SAP.
I love connecting with interesting and cool people all around the world 🌎 to talk about Tech, Culture and whatever connects us!

Not only am I crazy passionate about coding but I also do a lot of different types of sports. I like being outdoors, being with people and I go crazy when it comes to music!
